To use the observing script run:

`python observe_from_LT.py -nspec 100 -fname filename_string`

where `nspec` value must be an integer determining how many spectra are taken per coordinate and `fname` is what the files will
be named before the extra extensions such as `_noise_on.fits` or `_noise_off.fits`.
